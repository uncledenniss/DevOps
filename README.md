Dev Projects 
I Completed a PBL DevOps project curated by Darey.io
The early-mid part of this project was done on Azure cloud, further into the Project I switched to AWS.
I apologize for my 'probably' weird documentation if I fail to track any steps properly.
Also, a lot of these projects were done earlier so the interface on some of the service providers might've changed.
