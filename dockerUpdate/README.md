###  dockerFile Explanation

This is a rundown of my implementation of a docker training.
The content was created by **Nigel Poulton** (you should lookup the course on Pluralsight it is amazing)
The implementation covers how docker is installed, apps are deployed from images or stack files, volume storage is persisted, and container lifecycle management.

Thank you!
